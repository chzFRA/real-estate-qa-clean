(4A) In assessing, for the purposes of subsection (4), the benefits and negative
impacts of a proposed transfer, a local authority must have regard to the
following matters:
(a)
whether the transfer will promote—
(i)

the consequences and risks of not implementing the proposed transfer at
the proposed time:

existing communities of interest, and the extent to which the proposed
transfer will maintain linkages between communities (including iwi and

(5)
A local authority must notify the Minister of its intention to transfer a responsi‐
bility or accept a transfer of responsibility under this section.
(6)

local authority to undertake, exercise, and perform the transferred responsibil‐
ities.

with that responsibility, duty, or legal obligation; but
(b)
does not include a responsibility, duty, or legal obligation conferred by
or under any other Act, unless that Act provides that the responsibility,
duty, or legal obligation may be transferred in accordance with this
section.
(9)

(a)
delegate the exercise of any responsibility to another local authority; or
(b)
enter into a contractual agreement with another local authority for the
performance of any activity or function.

Decision making
48I
General scheme
(1)
This section sets out the general scheme of sections 48J to 48O. These are the
provisions of this Act that set out how a unitary authority with local boards
makes its decisions. This section is by way of explanation only and does not
limit or affect the other provisions of this Act or any other enactment.
(2)
Both the governing body and the local boards are responsible and democrati‐
cally accountable for the decision making of the unitary authority. Whether
responsibility for making any particular decision rests with the governing body
or with 1 or more local boards depends on the nature of the decision being
made.
(3)
Section 48J sets out the classes of decisions that the governing body must
make. Section 48K sets out the classes of decisions that local boards must
make. Both sections include a class of decisions in respect of non-regulatory
activities of the unitary authority within a local board area. The governing body
must allocate responsibility for decisions within this class to either itself or the
local board for the area, in accordance with the principles in section 48L(2).
The results of the allocation must then be set out in the long-term plan and the
annual plans of the unitary authority so that people of each local board area,
and any other persons, can easily determine whether the governing body or a
local board is responsible for any particular decision of the unitary authority.
(4)
To determine local wishes and priorities in relation to the non-regulatory activ‐
ities for which a local board is allocated responsibility, the board must consult
its communities. The local board does this by preparing a local board plan
under section 48N. This plan is used as a basis for the board to develop an
annual local board agreement with the governing body under section 48O in
which the nature, levels, and funding of the activities are set out.

Decision-making responsibilities of governing body
(1)
The governing body is responsible and democratically accountable for—
(a)
the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to any regula‐
tory responsibility, duty, or power conferred on, or applying to, the
unitary authority under this Act or any other enactment (for example,
the responsibilities, duties, or powers conferred on, or applying to, a
Part 4 s 48I

Act 1956, the Building Act 2004, and the Civil Defence Emergency
Management Act 2002); and
(b)
the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to—
(i)
transport networks and infrastructure; and
any non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority that are allo‐
cated to the governing body in accordance with section 48L; and
(c)
the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to the establish‐
ment and maintenance of capacity to provide, or to ensure the provi‐
sion of, services and facilities (including local activities) by the unitary
authority; and
(d)
the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to the governance
of its council-controlled organisations; and
(e)
the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to compliance
with section 101 (which relates to the financial management of a local
authority); and
(f)
reaching agreement with each local board (as set out in each local board
agreement) in respect of local activities for the local board areas.
(2)
Before making a decision described in subsection (1)(a) to (d), the governing
body must—
(a)
comply with any requirement of this Act; and
(b)
comply with any requirements of any other enactment; and
(c)
consider any views and preferences expressed by a local board if the
decision affects or may affect the responsibilities or operation of the
local board or the well-being of communities within its local board area.

Decision-making responsibilities of local boards
(1)
Despite section 41(3), each local board is responsible and democratically
accountable for—
(a)
the decision making of the unitary authority in relation to the non-regu‐
latory activities of the unitary authority that are allocated to the local
board in accordance with section 48L; and
(b)
identifying and communicating to the unitary authority the interests and
preferences of the people in its local board area in relation to the content
of the strategies, policies, plans, and bylaws of the unitary authority; and
Part 4 s 48K
(c)
identifying and developing bylaws specifically for its local board area,
and proposing them to the governing body under section 150B; and
(d)
reaching agreement with the governing body (as set out in the local
board agreement) in respect of local activities for its local board area.
(2)
In carrying out the responsibilities described in this section, a local board must
comply with the requirements of sections 76 to 82 as if every reference in those
sections to a local authority were a reference to a local board.
(3)
In carrying out the responsibilities described in this section, a local board must
collaborate and co-operate with 1 or more other local boards or any other body
or entity if the local board is satisfied that the interests and preferences of
communities within the local board area will be better served by doing so.

Principles for allocation of decision-making responsibilities of unitary
authority
(1)
Decision-making responsibility for any non-regulatory activity of the unitary
authority within a local board area must be allocated by the governing body—
(a)
to either the governing body or the local board for that area; and
(b)
in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (2); and
(c)
after considering the views and preferences expressed by the local board.
(2)
The principles are—
(a)
decision-making responsibility for a non-regulatory activity of the uni‐
tary authority within a local board area should be exercised by the local
board for that area unless paragraph (b) applies:
(b)
decision-making responsibility for a non-regulatory activity of the uni‐
tary authority within a local board area should be exercised by its gov‐
erning body if the nature of the activity is such that decision making on a
district-wide basis will better promote the interests of the communities in
the district because—
(i)
the impact of the decision will extend beyond the local board area;
or
effective decision making will require alignment or integration
with other decisions that are the responsibility of the governing
body; or
the benefits of a consistent or co-ordinated approach in the district
will outweigh the benefits of reflecting the particular needs and
preferences of the communities within the local board area.
(3)
The long-term plan and each annual plan must identify the non-regulatory
activities of the unitary authority for which decision-making responsibility is
Part 4 s 48L
allocated to 1 or more local boards as set out in clauses 17A and 21A of
Schedule 10.

Local boards funding policy
48M Local boards funding policy
(1)

boards, a unitary authority must adopt a local boards funding policy as part of
its long-term plan.
(2)
The local boards funding policy must set—
(a)
the basis on which the total funds to be allocated to meet the cost of all
local activities within the district is to be determined; and
(b)
the formula by which the total funds allocated by the unitary authority
for meeting the cost of funding local activities are to be allocated to each
local board; and
(c)
the formula by which the total funds allocated by the unitary authority
for meeting the cost of funding the administrative support to local boards
are to be allocated to each local board.
(3)
The local boards funding policy must also identify any funding (except funding
dedicated to particular purposes) that may be available to local boards for local
activities and the criteria or process by which it may be allocated to them.
(4)
The formula referred to in subsection (2)(b) must allocate funds to each local
board in a way that provides an equitable capacity for the local board to
enhance the well-being of the communities in its local board area, having
regard to the following factors:
(a)
the level of dependence on local government services and facilities in
each local board area and in other parts of the district (as informed
by information available to the unitary authority by reasonable means,
and relating to the socio-economic, population, age profile, and other
demographic characteristics of each local board area and other part of
the district); and
(b)
the costs of achieving and maintaining the identified levels of service
provision for local activities in each local board area; and
(c)
the rates revenue and any other revenue derived from each local board
area in relation to local activities; and
(d)
any other factor identified by the unitary authority as significantly affect‐
ing the nature and level of services needed in any local board area or
Part 4 s 48M
any other part of the district (for example, the geographic isolation of a
particular local board area or part of the district).
(5)
The formula referred to in subsection (2)(c) must allocate funds to each local
board in a way that provides equitable resources and support to that local
board, having regard to the following factors:
(a)
the number of elected members on the local board; and
(b)
the size of the local board area; and
(c)
any other factor identified by the unitary authority as significantly affect‐
ing the operational costs of the local board; and
(d)
the funding amount allocated to the local board under subsection (4).
(6)
If the unitary authority amends its local boards funding policy under section
93(4), only a significant amendment to the policy is required to be audited in
accordance with sections 93D(4) and 94.

ership or control interest in A that—
Part 2 s 11
(A)

(B)
is in securities of A of a different class to the class in which

What are overseas investments in significant business assets
(1)
An overseas investment in significant business assets is—
(a)
the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas
person, of rights or interests in securities of a person (A) if—
(i)
as a result of the acquisition, the overseas person or the associate
(either alone or together with its associates) has a more than 25%
ownership or control interest in A or an increase in an existing
more than 25% ownership or control interest in A of a type
referred to in section 12(1)(b)(ii); and
the value of the securities or consideration provided, or the value
of the assets of A or A and its more than 25% subsidiaries,
exceeds $100 million or an alternative monetary threshold that
applies in accordance with regulations made under section 61A; or
(b)
the establishment by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas
person, of a business in New Zealand (either alone or with any other
person) if—
Part 2 s 13
(i)
the business is carried on for more than 90 days in any year
(whether consecutively or in aggregate); and
the total expenditure expected to be incurred, before commencing
the business, in establishing that business exceeds $100 million or
an alternative monetary threshold that applies in accordance with
regulations made under section 61A; or
(c)
the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas
person, of property (including goodwill and other intangible assets) in
New Zealand used in carrying on business in New Zealand (whether by
1 transaction or a series of related or linked transactions) if the total
value of consideration provided exceeds $100 million or an alternative
monetary threshold that applies in accordance with regulations made
under section 61A.
(2)
However, an overseas person that was lawfully carrying on business in New
Zealand on 15 January 1996 (which was when the Overseas Investment
Regulations 1995 came into force) does not require consent for an overseas
investment in significant business assets described in subsection (1)(b) if the
investment requires consent only because it comes within that paragraph.

Criteria for consent
Approach to criteria for consent
(1)
The relevant Minister or Ministers, in considering whether or not to grant
consent to an overseas investment transaction,—
(a)
must have regard to only the criteria and factors that apply to the rele‐
vant category of overseas investment under this subpart (subject to this
section); and
(b)
may consult with any other person or persons, as the Minister or Minis‐
ters think appropriate; and
(c)
must grant consent if satisfied that all of the criteria in section 16 or
section 18 (as the case may be) are met; and
Part 2 s 14
(d)
must decline to grant consent if not satisfied that all of the criteria in
section 16 or section 18 are met.
(2)
For a transaction that is in more than 1 category of overseas investment, the
relevant Ministers must have regard to the criteria that apply to all of the
relevant categories.
(3)
However, if the criteria are the same, the relevant Ministers only need to
consider the same criteria once (and not consider them under each relevant
category).
Who are relevant overseas persons, and individuals with control, for
overseas investments
(1)
The relevant Minister or Ministers may determine which 1 or more of the
following persons is the relevant overseas person for an overseas investment:
(a)
the person making the overseas investment (A), whether A is an over‐
seas person or an associate of an overseas person:
(b)
any associate of A in relation to the overseas investment.
(2)
The relevant Minister or Ministers may determine which 1 or more of the fol‐
lowing categories of persons are the individuals with control of the relevant
overseas person for an overseas investment:
(a)
the individual or individuals who each have a more than 25% ownership
or control interest in the relevant overseas person:
(b)
the member or members of the governing body of the relevant overseas
(c)
the individual or body of individuals who the Minister or Ministers
consider to have that control (whether directly or indirectly).

vidual) each of the individuals with control of the relevant over‐
seas person is, a New Zealand citizen, ordinarily resident in New
Zealand, or intending to reside in New Zealand indefinitely; or
Criteria if relevant land is all residential and some or all is sensitive for
some other reason
(d)
if the relevant land is residential land but is not described in paragraph
(b),—
(i)
the commitment to reside in New Zealand test is met; or
Criteria if some relevant land is residential and some or all is sensitive

Additional criteria if land includes farm land
(f)
if the relevant land is or includes farm land, before a transaction is
entered into with the relevant overseas person, the farm land or section
12 interest has been offered for acquisition on the open market to per‐
sons who are not overseas persons as required by the regulations (but see
section 20):
Additional criteria for transaction of national interest
(g)
if the overseas investment in sensitive land is a transaction of national
interest, the Minister has not declined consent to the transaction (see
section 20C).
(2)
(3)
The investor test does not apply to an overseas investment in sensitive land if
either of the following circumstances applies:
(a)
Circumstance 1:
(i)
the application for consent is under the commitment to reside in
New Zealand test only; and
the relevant land is residential (but not otherwise sensitive) land:
(b)
Circumstance 2:
(i)
the application for consent is under the increased housing test
only; and
the increased housing outcome under the test is to be met by a
development described in clause 4(1) of Schedule 3 (large apart‐
ment developments); and
the estate or interest in land relates to 1 or more new residential
dwellings in that development; and
the transaction is entered into before the construction of the dwell‐
ing is complete.
(4)
See also clause 4(5) of Schedule 2 (which relates to the commitment to reside
in New Zealand test and relationship property) for a circumstance in which an
individual with control of the relevant overseas person can be disregarded in
determining whether the investor test is met.

Benefit to New Zealand test
Outline
(1AA) This subsection shows the ways in which the benefit to New Zealand test can
be met, but it is a guide only to the general scheme and effect of this section.

Subsections (4) to (9)
N/a
General test
(1)
The benefit to New Zealand test is met if both of the following are met:
(a)
the overseas investment will, or is likely to, benefit New Zealand (or
any part of it or group of New Zealanders) to the extent required by this
section, as determined by the relevant Ministers under section 17; and
(b)
if the relevant land is or includes residential land, the relevant Ministers
are satisfied that the conditions that the relevant Ministers will impose
on the consent in accordance with section 16B will be, or are likely to
be, met.
(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the relevant Ministers—
(a)
must assess the benefit to New Zealand (or any part of it or group of
New Zealanders) by comparing the likely result of the overseas invest‐
ment against the existing state of affairs as at the time the overseas
investment transaction is entered into or the time the application is made,
whichever occurs first (counterfactual); and
(b)
must take a proportionate approach to whether the benefit test is met, by
taking into account whether that benefit is proportionate to the follow‐
ing:
(i)
the sensitivity of the land (for example, the importance to New
Zealand of the purpose for which the land is used, the size and
value of the land, any sensitive features associated with the land,
and the level of interest that the public have in the land) or the
fishing quota; and
the nature of the overseas investment transaction (for example, the
estate or interest being acquired, whether the estate or interest is
temporary or permanent, and the degree of overseas ownership or
control of the land or of the estate or interest in land).
(1B) However, subsection (1A) does not apply if subsection (4) applies.
Modified benefit test if relevant land is or includes farm land
(1C) If the relevant land is or includes farm land that in area exceeds 5 hectares, the
relevant Ministers must—
(a)
give the following factors high relative importance:
(i)
the economic benefits factor in section 17(1)(a) and, in particular,
the creation or retention of jobs, introduction of technology or
business skills, increased export receipts, and increased process‐
ing of primary products; and
the oversight or participation factor in section 17(1)(f); and
(b)
ensure that the applicant has demonstrated, in relation to 1 or more of
those factors, that the benefits of the investment are of a size or nature
that represent a substantial benefit to New Zealand.
(1D) However, the relevant Ministers may determine not to apply subsection (1C) if
they are satisfied that—
(a)
the transaction is minor or technical; or
(b)
the transaction does not materially change the level of ownership or
control that the relevant overseas person has over the asset; or
(c)
the farm land has no or limited productive capacity as farm land and
will, or is likely to, be used promptly, as a result of the overseas
investment, for industrial or commercial development (for example, a
supermarket) or for the construction of 1 or more buildings that, taken
together, will consist of 20 or more new residential dwellings.
(1E)
Subsection (1C) does not preclude the relevant Ministers also giving other
factors high relative importance.
(2)
Subsection (1C) does not apply if the relevant Ministers are satisfied—
(a)
that, as a result of the overseas investment, the farm land will, or is
likely to, be used exclusively, or nearly exclusively, for forestry activ‐
ities; and
(b)
that, whenever a crop of trees is harvested on the farm land, a new crop
will be, or is likely to be, established on the farm land to replace the crop
that is harvested (subject to subsection (7)); and
(c)
that the non-occupation outcome will, or is likely to, occur in relation
to the farm land (where that outcome in clause 17(3) to (5) of Schedule
2 applies with necessary modifications as if the reference to residential
land were a reference to the farm land).
(3)
Special test relating to forestry activities
(4)
Regulations may provide that the benefit to New Zealand test is also met if the
relevant Ministers are satisfied—
(a)
that the relevant land is already used when the transaction is entered
into, and will continue to be used, exclusively, or nearly exclusively, for
forestry activities; and
(b)
(i)
the relevant land is not residential land only; and
if the relevant land includes any residential land, the residential
land adjoins other land that is included in the relevant land but is
not residential land; and
(c)
that the non-occupation outcome will, or is likely to, occur in relation to
the relevant land (where that outcome in clause 17(3) to (5) of Schedule
2 applies with necessary modifications as if the reference to residential
land were a reference to the relevant land); and
(d)
that any requirements set out in regulations in accordance with subsec‐
tion (5) will be, or are likely to be, met (subject to subsection (8)); and
(e)
that, whenever a crop of trees is harvested on the relevant land, a new
crop will be, or is likely to be, established on the relevant land to replace
the crop that is harvested (subject to subsection (7)); and
(f)
(g)
that any other requirements set out in regulations are met.
(4A) To avoid doubt, the reference in subsection (2)(a) to the use of the farm land
and the reference in subsection (4)(a) to the use of the relevant land mean the
use that arises under the estate or interest referred to in section 12(1)(a).
(5)
Regulations may, for the purposes of subsection (4)(d), set out requirements
that must be met after the overseas investment is given effect to.
(6)
Requirements set out in regulations for the purposes of subsection (4)(d) may
(without limitation) be about 1 or more of the following:
(a)
activities that must, or must not, be carried out on the relevant land:
(b)
the maintenance or protection of things that exist when or before the
overseas investment transaction is entered into (including (without limi‐
tation) the maintenance of existing arrangements relating to historic
heritage, biodiversity, environmental matters, public access, or the sup‐
ply of logs):
(c)
outcomes that must result from the overseas investment.
Powers not to apply, or to modify, certain requirements
(7)
The relevant Ministers may decide—
(a)
not to apply the requirement set out in subsection (2)(b) or (4)(e) if
satisfied that the relevant overseas person (together with the relevant
overseas person’s associates) will not have sufficient ownership or con‐
trol (direct or indirect) of rights in respect of the relevant land to ensure
that the requirement will be met:
(b)
to modify the requirement set out in subsection (2)(b) or (4)(e) by not
applying the requirement for a part of the relevant land if satisfied
that the relevant overseas person (together with the relevant overseas
person’s associates) will not have sufficient ownership or control (direct
or indirect) of rights in respect of that part of the relevant land to ensure
that the requirement will be met for that part of the relevant land.
(8)
The relevant Ministers may decide not to apply, or may modify, any require‐
ment set out in regulations for the purposes of subsection (4)(d) if satisfied
that the relevant overseas person (together with the relevant overseas person’s
associates) will not have sufficient ownership or control (direct or indirect) of
rights in respect of the relevant land to ensure that the requirement will be met.

Conditions for consents relating to sensitive land that is residential land:
benefit to New Zealand test
(1)
This section applies if an application for consent for an overseas investment in
sensitive land is being considered under the benefit to New Zealand test and
the relevant land is or includes residential land.
(2)
However, this section does not apply (and see instead section 16C)—
(a)
to the extent that the relevant land is farm land and the relevant Minis‐
ters are satisfied in accordance with section 16A(2); or
(b)
where the application is being considered in accordance with section
16A(4).
(3)
If consent is granted, to the extent that the consent relates to the residential
land,—
(a)
the relevant Ministers must determine a residential land outcome listed
in the table in clause 19 of Schedule 2 as applying to the residential land;
and
(b)
the consent must be made subject to the set of conditions for the residen‐
tial land outcome, subject to any exemptions applying (in each case, as
described in the table).
(4)
Consent may be granted on the basis of different residential land outcomes
applying for different parts of the residential land (with different sets of condi‐
tions imposed for different parts).
A is an overseas person who wants to buy 100% of the shares in what is currently
a 100% New Zealand-owned and -controlled company.
The company owns the following sensitive land (and has no other interests in
sensitive land):
•
40 hectares of non-urban land (that is not residential land):
•
residential land where 2 houses are being constructed.
No part of the land is, or will be, used for forestry activities.
Criteria for consent
Because the relevant land is a mix of sensitive (but not residential) land and
residential land, section 16(1)(e) applies and (in addition to the other criteria in
section 16(1) that apply) the benefit to New Zealand test must be met in relation to
all of the relevant land.
Residential land outcomes
Because the relevant land includes residential land, section 16A(1)(b) applies.
A wants to complete and sell one of the houses and live in the other house. A’s
application for consent proposes the following residential land outcomes (from the
table in clause 19 of Schedule 2) for the residential land:
Part 2 s 16B
•
occupation as a main home or residence (on the basis that the commitment
to reside in New Zealand test will be met in respect of part of the residential
land):
•
increased residential dwellings (for the remaining part of the residential
land).
Required conditions
If consent is granted, each part of the residential land will be covered by a set of
conditions (see clause 19 of Schedule 2) for the residential land outcomes that the
relevant Ministers determine apply.
(See also sections 25A and 25B, in relation to the imposition of conditions gener-
ally.)

Factors for assessing benefit of overseas investments in sensitive land
What are the factors
(1)
The factors for assessing the benefit of overseas investments in sensitive land
are whether the overseas investment will, or is likely to,—
(a)
result in economic benefits for New Zealand (for example, the creation
or retention of jobs, the introduction of technology or business skills,
increases in productivity or export receipts, or a reduced risk of illiquid
assets):
(b)
result in benefits to the natural environment (for example, protection of
indigenous flora and fauna or erosion control):
(c)
result in continued or enhanced access by the public, or any section of
the public, within or over the sensitive land or the features giving rise
to the sensitivity (for example, access for recreational purposes or for
the purposes of undertaking stewardship of, or exercising kaitiakitanga
in relation to, historic heritage or the natural environment):
(d)
result in continued or enhanced protection of historic heritage in or on
the relevant land (for example, agreement to execute a heritage covenant
(or comply with existing covenants), agreement to support entry to wāhi
tūpuna, wāhi tapu, or wāhi tapu areas on the New Zealand Heritage List/
Rārangi Kōrero, taking other actions under the Heritage New Zealand
Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 to recognise or protect heritage values, or
agreement to land being set apart as a Māori reservation):
(e)
give effect to or advance a significant Government policy:
(f)
involve oversight of, or participation in, the overseas investment or any
relevant overseas person by persons who are not overseas persons:
(g)
result in other consequential benefits to New Zealand.
How factors must be considered
(2)
For the purposes of section 16A(1)(a) and (b), the relevant Ministers—
(a)
must consider all the factors in subsection (1) to determine which factor
or factors are relevant to the overseas investment; and
(b)
must determine whether the criteria in section 16A(1)(a) and (b) are met
after having regard to those relevant factors and, in doing so,—
(i)
must deduct from any benefit arising under a factor any directly
comparable aspect of the counterfactual, and any negative impact
of the overseas investment that is directly comparable, but must
stop deducting at zero unless subsection (3) applies:
Part 2 s 17
must not deduct from any benefit arising under a factor any non-
directly comparable aspect of the counterfactual or any negative
impact of the overseas investment that is not directly comparable
unless subsection (3) applies:
Examples
Directly comparable
If a company is generating $10 million in export receipts at the time
that the overseas investment transaction is entered into and the over-
seas investment will result in a total of $15 million in export receipts,
the net benefit in respect of export receipts under the economic
factor is $5 million.
Non-directly comparable
If the overseas investment will result in an increase in jobs, but a
decrease in export receipts, as compared with the counterfactual,
the decrease in export receipts cannot be deducted from the benefit
associated with the increase in jobs.
If an overseas investment will result in the introduction of technology
but a decrease in export receipts, the decrease in export receipts
must not be deducted from any benefits arising from the introduction
of technology.
must determine the relative importance to be given to each rele‐
vant factor or particular benefit arising under a factor, subject to
section 16A(1C).
(3)
If the overseas investment involves the extraction of water for bottling, or other
extraction of water in bulk for human consumption,—
(a)
an additional factor is whether the overseas investment will, or is likely
to, result in a negative impact on water quality or sustainability; and
(b)
the relevant Ministers must determine the relative importance to be
given to this factor and deduct that from any overall benefit to New
Zealand that has been determined under section 16A(1)(a).

Investor test
Purpose
(1)
The purpose of the investor test is to determine whether investors are unsuita‐

Exemptions from farm land offer criterion
Powers to exempt
(1)
Section 16(1)(f) does not apply to an overseas investment if—
(a)
the relevant Ministers consider that the overseas investment need not
meet this criterion by reason of the circumstances relating to the par‐
ticular overseas investment or section 12 interest or the nature of the
land to which the section 12 interest relates (for example, its productive
capacity); or
(b)
the overseas person making the overseas investment belongs to a class
of overseas persons, or the overseas investment transaction belongs to a
class of transactions, that is exempted from this criterion by the relevant
Ministers.
(2)
The relevant Ministers may also exempt a person or transaction from—
(a)
the requirement that offers for acquisition must be on the open market:
(b)
any other requirement in regulations about how farm land or section 12
interests must be advertised.

(a)
there are circumstances that mean that it is necessary, appropriate, or
desirable to provide an exemption; and
(b)
the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary
to address those circumstances.
(4)
In so considering, the relevant Ministers—
(a)
must have regard to the purpose of this Act; and
(b)
may have regard to any other factors that seem to those Ministers to be
relevant to the circumstances.

An exemption made under subsection (1)(a) or (2) must be published on an
Internet site maintained by, or on behalf of, the regulator, together with the
reasons of the relevant Ministers for granting the exemption.
However, publication under subsection (9) may be deferred or dispensed with

case the relevant Ministers must publish the reason for deferring or dispensing
with publication and the grounds in support of that reason.

Transactions of national interest
Heading: inserted, on 16 June 2020, by section 17 of the Overseas Investment (Urgent Measures)
20A
Transactions that are transactions of national interest
Transactions involving non-NZ government investors or SIB
(1)
The following kinds of overseas investment transactions are transactions of
national interest:
Investment by non-NZ government investors
(a)
a transaction of a kind described in section 12(1)(a) or 13(1)(c) of this
Act, or in section 57D(a) of the Fisheries Act 1996, where, as a result of
the acquisition, the relevant estate or interest in land, property, or fishing
quota is acquired by a non-NZ government investor:
(b)
a transaction of a kind described in section 12(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or 13(1)(a)
of this Act, or in section 57D(b) of the Fisheries Act 1996, where, as a

(1A) However, for the purpose of subsection (1)(a) and (b), references to a “relevant
government investor or investors” in the definition of relevant government
enterprise in section 6(1) include only relevant government investors from the

An acquisition by a company of which a New South Wales Government pension
fund owns 15% and a Victorian Government pension fund owns 15% is a transac-
tion of national interest (because Australia is the single country). But an acquisition

The Minister must notify an applicant if the Minister considers that an applica‐
tion for consent involves a transaction of the kind set out in subsection (1),
unless the applicant has already identified this in their application.

relevant Ministers are satisfied, in respect of A, that—
(a)

Criteria for all exemptions
(1)

exemption under section 61D, only if the Minister considers—
Part 2 s 61C
(a)
that there are circumstances that mean that it is necessary, appropriate,
or desirable to provide an exemption for any of the matters referred to in
section 61B(a) to (c); and
(b)
that the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably neces‐
sary to address those circumstances.
(2)
In so considering, the Minister—
(a)
must have regard to the purpose of this Act; and
(b)
may have regard to all or any of the following:
(i)
the extent to which effective ownership or control is changed
by the overseas investment or remains with persons who are not
overseas persons:
the extent to which a sensitive asset is already held in overseas
ownership or control:
the extent to which the acquisition is the result of the operation
of other legislation or an event outside the control of the overseas
the extent of time an overseas person is likely to have ownership
or control of a right or an interest, for what purpose, and the
likely impact on the sensitive asset of that overseas ownership or
control:
(v)
any other factors that seem to the Minister to be relevant to the
circumstances.

for conditions of consents, to the extent set out in the regulations, to
continue in effect as conditions of the consents but on the basis set out in
the regulations (whether or not the person who relies on the exemption is
a consent holder):
(b)
for the person who relies on the exemption to be treated as a consent
holder to the extent set out in the regulations:
(c)
for consent holders to cease to be subject to the conditions of their
consents to the extent set out in the regulations.
Part 2 s 61F
(4)
An exemption may at any time be amended or revoked in the same way as
it may be made (for example, section 61E applies with all necessary modifica‐
tions).
(5)
The reasons of the Minister for recommending the regulations or granting an
exemption (including why the exemption is necessary, appropriate, or desira‐
ble) must be published together with the regulations or exemption.
(6)
However, the publication of an exemption under section 61D, or of the reasons
for granting any exemption, may be deferred or dispensed with (in whole or
in part) if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that good reason for
withholding the exemption or the reasons (as the case may be) would exist
under the Official Information Act 1982.

in connection with property:
a person (A) relies on an exemption in, or an exemption granted
under, this Act or the regulations that is subject to 1 or more
conditions that apply in connection with property:
because of the previous operation of this section, a person (A)
is treated as being subject to 1 or more conditions that apply in
connection with property; and

A ceases to be subject to the conditions in the circumstances, and to the extent,
provided for in the regulations.

Total term of interest in land
s 12
Schedule 1A: inserted, on 5 July 2021, by section 33 of the Overseas Investment Amendment Act
Calculation of total term of interest in land
(1)
The total term of an interest in land is the duration of—
(a)
(i)
the term of the interest acquired; or
in the case of an interest that is part-way through its current term,
the remainder of any current term of the interest as at the time the
overseas investment transaction is entered into; and
(b)
any rights of renewal of that interest (whether of the grantor or grantee);
and
(c)
any previous interest that relates to the same or substantially the same
land; and
(d)
if a previous interest was separated in time by a periodic interest, that
periodic interest.
An overseas person was a tenant of a lease of sensitive land for a term of 9 years
with no rights of renewal. At the end of that lease, the parties enter into a 2-year
extension.
The total term of the interest is 11 years: 2 years’ extension plus 9 years under
the previous lease. The acquisition of the extension is an overseas investment in
sensitive land, and consent is required.
(2)
A previous interest, in relation to an interest in land, is an estate (other than a
freehold estate) or interest in land that—
(a)
was held by—
(i)
the overseas person or an associate of the overseas person; or
a person in which the overseas person or their associate (either
alone or together with its associates) had a more than 25% owner‐
ship or control interest; and
(b)
was consecutive in time to the relevant interest or to another previous
interest of the relevant interest.
(3)
The duration of a previous interest before the overseas person or their associate
had a more than 25% ownership or control interest in the person who held that
previous interest must be disregarded from the calculation of the total term.
A tenant has a lease of land for a term of 10 years. In year 6 of the lease, an
overseas person increases their ownership interest in the tenant from 15% interest
to 30%. At the end of the lease, the tenant enters into a new lease of the same
land for a 5-year term.
The total term of the interest is 9 years: 5 years in the new lease plus 4 years of
the previous lease from the point that the overseas person invested in the tenant.
The acquisition of the new lease is not an overseas investment in sensitive land.
(4)
consecutive includes separated by—
(a)
any periodic interest; or
(b)
a period of less than 4 months
periodic interest means any interest in land that—
(a)
is terminable at will, whether by the grantor or the grantee; and
(b)
offers no certainty of term of 4 months or more (including rights of
renewal, whether of the grantor or the grantee).
An overseas person was a tenant under a lease of sensitive land for 5 years. The
tenant held over after the lease expired. No consent is required for that periodic
lease (see clause 2 of Schedule 3).
After a year of holding over, the tenant enters into a new lease with the landlord for
another 5 years.
The new lease is the acquisition of an interest in land. The total term of the interest
is 11 years: 5 years in the new lease, 1 year of holding over, and 5 years under
the previous lease. The acquisition of the new lease is an overseas investment in
sensitive land, and consent is required.

(a)
2 individuals (A and B) who would be key individuals under subclause
(3) are the spouse or partner of each other; and
(b)
(i)
the relevant interest in the residential land will be acquired as
relationship property of A and B and regulations exempt B from
the requirement for consent under section 10(1)(a); or
the interest in the residential land will be acquired by a company
that is incorporated in New Zealand and in which all of the secur‐
ities are wholly owned as relationship property by A and B, on the
basis that A is a key individual,—
then B is not a key individual for the overseas investment.
(5)
B (but not A) can also be disregarded for the overseas investment when deter‐
mining whether the investor test is met if—
(a)
the application for consent is under the commitment to reside in New
Zealand test only; and
(b)
the investor test applies (because the relevant land is or includes residen‐
tial land and land that is sensitive under Part 1 of Schedule 1 for some
other reason); and
(c)
the relevant Ministers are satisfied that A is an individual with control
of the relevant overseas person (for example, if the relevant overseas
person is a company).

(a)
because of the circumstances relating to the particular relevant overseas
person and the purpose of the overseas investment; and

1 or more of the following outcomes (the increased housing outcomes)
will, or are likely to, occur on the residential land:
(i)
an increase in the number of residential dwellings constructed on
the residential land (including an increase from 0):

dential land, or an increase in the number of dwellings in a long-
term accommodation facility that is on the residential land:
development works on the land to support the doing of things
described in either or both of subparagraphs (i) and (ii); and
(b)
the following outcomes (as defined in clause 17) will, or are likely to,

tion facility will, or is likely to, operate from the residential land within
a specified period, to the extent that the relevant Ministers are satisfied
that the land will, or is likely to, be used for those operations; or
(b)
if an exemption under clause 20 (exemption for large developments with
shared equity, rent-to-buy, and rental arrangements) applies.
(3)
The increased housing outcomes are measured by comparing the expected
result of the overseas investment against the state of the residential land before
the transaction takes effect.

(a)
the residential land is a single site, or adjacent sites separated by infra‐
structure (such as roads), with 1 or more buildings that, taken together,
consist of 20 or more dwellings suitable for use as, or conversion to,
residential dwellings; and
(b)
at least 20 of the residential dwellings will be, or are likely to be,
available for use, within a time frame that is satisfactory to the relevant
Ministers, as a residential dwelling occupied under a residential tenancy

relevant business:
(a)

(b)
a business of a person (B) if A owns or controls the relevant interest
in the residential land primarily for B to use the residential land in that

used for non-residential purposes in the ordinary course of business for
the relevant business; and
(b)
not used, nor held for future use, for any residential purposes.
(2)
In any case where the relevant Ministers are not satisfied that the matters in
subclause (1)(a) and (b) (the non-residential use outcome) will, or are likely
to, occur within a short period after the overseas investment is given effect
under the transaction, they may determine that the non-residential use test is
met if—
(a)
(i)
the relevant Ministers are satisfied that the non-occupation out‐
come (as defined in clause 17) will, or is likely to, occur; or
the incidental residential use test is applied for and met in respect
of the residential land; and
(b)
the relevant Ministers are satisfied that, within a specified period, the
non-residential use outcome will be, or is likely to be, met.
(3)

tial use test is met only in respect of part of the residential land and no other
test is applied for and met in respect of the remaining part of the residential
land.
(4)
The relevant Ministers may determine that the non-residential use test is met if
they are satisfied that the on-sale outcome (as defined in clause 17) will, or is
likely to, occur for the remaining part of the residential land.
(5)
How incidental residential use test is met
(1)
The incidental residential use test is met if the relevant Ministers are satisfied
(a)
the residential land will be, or is likely to be (or will, or is likely to,
continue to be) used for residential purposes but only in support of
the relevant business, where the relevant business is not (or is only
exceptionally) in the business of using land for residential purposes (the
incidental residential use outcome); and
(b)
having regard to that use of the residential land, the relevant interest in
the residential land will be, or is likely to be, acquired in the ordinary
course of the business of the relevant overseas person.
(2)
In considering whether the incidental residential use test is met, the relevant
Ministers may have regard to all or any of the following:
(a)
whether any reasonable alternative exists to the acquisition of the rele‐
vant interest in the residential land:
(b)
the proximity of the residential land to the premises or operations of the
relevant business:
(c)
whether the use of the residential land for residential purposes is (with‐
out limitation) as accommodation for staff engaged in the relevant busi‐
ness:
(d)
any other factors that seem to the relevant Ministers to be relevant in the
circumstances.
(3)
Subclause (4) applies if the relevant Ministers determine that the incidental
residential use test is met only in respect of part of the residential land and
no other test is applied for and met in respect of the remaining part of the
residential land.
(4)
The relevant Ministers may determine that the incidental residential use test is
met if they are satisfied that the on-sale outcome (as defined in clause 17) will,
or is likely to, occur for the remaining part of the residential land.
(5)
Part 4
For the purposes of section 16(1)(b)(i), different tests in this schedule can be
met in respect of different parts of the residential land that is, or is included in,
the relevant land so long as at least 1 test is met in respect of each part of the
residential land.
A is an overseas person who wishes to buy a company. The company owns land
that is residential (but not otherwise sensitive) land and has no other direct or
indirect interest in land that is sensitive land. The land contains a house that A
wants to live in and part of the land is undeveloped land on which A wants to build
houses for on-sale.
A applies for consent on the basis of the commitment to reside in New Zealand
test and the increased housing test.
Part 5
(1)
This Part sets out conditions to be imposed on consents that are granted for
overseas investments in sensitive land on the basis that—
(a)
1 or more of the tests in Part 3 are met; or
(b)
the benefit to New Zealand test is met, the relevant land is or includes
residential land, and section 16B applies.

granted on the basis that the commitment to reside in New Zealand test
is met):
(b)
sections 25A and 25B in relation to the imposition of conditions gener‐
ally.
What are on-sale outcome and non-occupation outcome
(1)
This clause defines the on-sale outcome and the non-occupation outcome for
the purposes of various conditions and related tests.
(2)
The on-sale outcome is that, within a specified period, the relevant overseas
person disposes of all relevant interests in the residential land.
(3)
The non-occupation outcome is that, for so long as the relevant overseas
person has a relevant interest in the residential land, none of the following
occupy the land for residential purposes:
(a)
the relevant overseas person (A):
(b)
any overseas person (B) who has a more than 25% ownership or control
interest in A:
(c)
any overseas person (C) who occupies the land otherwise than on arm’s-
length terms (for example, a relative who occupies rent-free), where
arm’s-length terms means terms that—
(i)
would be reasonable in the circumstances if the owner of the land
(including their property agent) and C (including their associates)
were connected or related only by the transaction in question, each
acting independently, and each acting in its own best interests; or
are less favourable to C than the terms referred to in subparagraph
(i):
(d)
any overseas person who has a beneficial interest in, or beneficial
entitlement to, the relevant interest in the residential land:
(e)
if A is a trust, a person who may (directly or indirectly) benefit under the
trust at the discretion of the trustees.
(4)
However, subclause (3)(c) to (e) do not apply to a person who is entitled to
occupy the land under any consent or any exemption in this Act or the regula‐
tions (for example, a person who has consent on the basis of the commitment
to reside in New Zealand test may be entitled to lease a new dwelling in
respect of which the developer is subject to a non-occupation outcome under
the increased housing test).
(5)
For the purposes of section 16A(2)(c) and (4)(c), subclause (3)(c) does not
apply to the extent that—
(a)
accommodation is being provided for the purpose only of supporting
forestry activities (as defined in section 16A(9)) being carried out on the
farm land (in the case of section 16A(2)(c)) or the relevant land (in the
case of section 16A(4)(c)); and
(b)
all the buildings being used for that accommodation are located on land
on which some or all of those forestry activities are being carried out or
on land that adjoins land on which some or all of those forestry activities
are being carried out.

wise sensitive) land:
the benefit to New Zealand test in respect of land that is or

will be increased by 20 or more.
Exemption certificates
(2)
A person involved in the development (the developer) may apply for an
exemption certificate if regulations are in force under section 61(1)(jb).
(3)
The relevant Minister or Ministers may grant an exemption certificate if they
are satisfied that the development is likely to be completed, having regard to
factors such as—
(a)
whether the development has appropriate resource consent, building
consent, and any other relevant authorisations; and
(b)
the developer’s financial strength; and
(c)
the previous activity of the developer (or its associates or individuals
with control) regarding use of residential land; and

OP2 later buys a different apartment to which the exemption certificate does not
apply. OP2 must apply for consent (but see section 16(3)(b) for an exemption from
the investor test if OP2 applies for consent under the increased housing test.) OP2
must comply with the conditions of that consent as to the on-sale outcome and the
non-occupation outcome.

(b)
conditions that impose the non-occupation outcome on purchasers who
rely on the exemption certificate under subclause (5); and
(c)
conditions that enable the non-occupation outcome to be monitored by
the regulator.

Those conditions may be conditions—
(a)
that apply to either the developer (as a condition of the exemption certif‐
icate) or the purchaser (as a condition of the exemption in subclause (5)),

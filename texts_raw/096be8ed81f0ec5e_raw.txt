Certain existing building works allowed
(1)
Land may be used in a manner that contravenes a rule in a district plan or pro‐

be lawfully established in accordance with subsection (2).
(2)
Subject to subsection (3), the building work or intended use of the building
shall be deemed to be lawfully established if—
(a)
a building consent was issued and any amendments were incorporated in
the building consent in accordance with the Building Act 2004 for the
building work or intended use of the building before the rule in a district
plan or proposed district plan took legal effect in accordance with sec‐
tion 86B or 149N(8); and
(b)
the building work or intended use of the building, as stated on the build‐

Subsection (2) shall not apply if—
(a)
the building consent is amended (after the rule in the district plan or pro‐

use of a building will no longer be the same or similar in character,
intensity, and scale as before the amendment; or
(b)
the building consent has lapsed or is cancelled, but the issuing under the
Building Act 2004 of a code compliance certificate in respect of the
building work shall not, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to
have cancelled the building consent for that work; or
(c)
a code compliance certificate for the building work has not been issued
in accordance with the Building Act 2004 within 2 years after the rule in
the district plan or proposed district plan took legal effect in accordance

36AAA Criteria for fixing administrative charges
(1)
When fixing charges under section 36, a local authority must have regard to the
criteria set out in this section.
(2)
The sole purpose of a charge is to recover the reasonable costs incurred by the
local authority in respect of the activity to which the charge relates.
(3)
A particular person or particular persons should be required to pay a charge
only—
(a)
to the extent that the benefit of the local authority’s actions to which the
charge relates is obtained by those persons as distinct from the commu‐
nity of the local authority as a whole; or
(b)
where the need for the local authority’s actions to which the charge
relates results from the actions of those persons; or
(c)
in a case where the charge is in respect of the local authority’s monitor‐
ing functions under section 35(2)(a) (which relates to monitoring the
state of the whole or part of the environment),—
(i)
to the extent that the monitoring relates to the likely effects on the
environment of those persons’ activities; or
(ii)
to the extent that the likely benefit to those persons of the moni‐
toring exceeds the likely benefit of the monitoring to the commu‐
nity of the local authority as a whole.
(4)
The local authority may fix different charges for different costs it incurs in the
performance of its various functions, powers, and duties under this Act—
(a)
in relation to different areas or different classes of applicant, consent
holder, requiring authority, or heritage protection authority; or
(b)
where any activity undertaken by the persons liable to pay any charge
reduces the cost to the local authority of carrying out any of its func‐
tions, powers, and duties.
Section 36AAA: inserted, on 19 April 2017, by section 21 of the Resource Legislation Amendment
Act 2017 (2017 No 15).
36AAB Other matters relating to administrative charges
(1)
A local authority may, in any particular case and in its absolute discretion,
remit the whole or any part of any charge of a kind referred to in section 36 that
would otherwise be payable.
(2)
Where a charge of a kind referred to in section 36 is payable to a local author‐
ity, the local authority need not perform the action to which the charge relates
until the charge has been paid to it in full.

(3)
However, subsection (2) does not apply to a charge to which section
36(1)(ab)(ii), (ad)(ii), or (cb)(iv) applies (relating to independent hearings com‐
missioners requested by submitters or reviews required by a court order).
(4)
A local authority must publish and maintain, on an Internet site to which the
public has free access, an up-to-date list of charges fixed under section 36.
Section 36AAB: inserted, on 19 April 2017, by section 21 of the Resource Legislation Amendment
Act 2017 (2017 No 15).
36AA Local authority policy on discounting administrative charges
(1)
A local authority must provide a discount on an administrative charge imposed
under section 36 as follows:
(a)
a local authority that has not adopted a policy under subsection (3) must
provide a discount if regulations under section 360(1)(hj) require the
local authority to provide a discount:
(b)
a local authority that has adopted a policy under subsection (3) must pro‐
vide a discount under whichever of the policy and regulations under sec‐
tion 360(1)(hj) is more generous in the circumstances of the particular
case.
(2)
The Minister must recommend to the Governor-General within 9 months of the
commencement of section 32 of the Resource Management (Simplifying and
Streamlining) Amendment Act 2009 that regulations be made under section
360(1)(hj) and the Minister must, before making the recommendation, consult
with local authorities about the proposed regulations.
(2A) The Minister must ensure that regulations made under section 360(1)(hj)
remain in force, but this subsection does not prevent regulations made under
section 360(1)(hj) (including the regulations made in compliance with subsec‐
tion (2)) from being amended or from being revoked and replaced by another
set of regulations made under section 360(1)(hj).
(3)
A local authority may adopt, in accordance with the special consultative pro‐
cedure set out in section 83 of the Local Government Act 2002, a policy in
respect of discounting administrative charges imposed under section 36 of this
Act in the circumstances where—
(a)
an application for a resource consent or an application to change or can‐
cel conditions under section 127 is not processed within the time frames
set out in this Act; and
(b)
the responsibility for the failure rests with the local authority.
(4)
The policy must specify—
(a)
the discount, or the method for determining the discount, that would be
given for any application fees or charges paid or owing; and
(b)
the procedure an applicant must follow to obtain the discount.

Striking out submissions
(1)
An authority conducting a hearing on a matter described in section 39(1) may
direct that a submission or part of a submission be struck out if the authority is
satisfied that at least 1 of the following applies to the submission or the part:

it is frivolous or vexatious:

it discloses no reasonable or relevant case:
(c)
it would be an abuse of the hearing process to allow the submission or
the part to be taken further:
(d)
it is supported only by evidence that, though purporting to be independ‐
ent expert evidence, has been prepared by a person who is not independ‐
ent or who does not have sufficient specialised knowledge or skill to
give expert evidence on the matter:
(e)
it contains offensive language.
(2)

the location of waahi tapu; or
(b)
to avoid the disclosure of a trade secret or unreasonable prejudice to the
commercial position of the person who supplied, or is the subject of, the
information,—

such offence, disclosure, or prejudice outweighs the public interest in making
that information available.
(2)
A local authority may make an order for the purpose of subsection (1)—
(a)
that the whole or part of any hearing or class of hearing at which the
information is likely to be referred to, shall be held with the public

whether or not the information may be material to any proposal, applica‐
tion, or requirement.
(3)
An order made under subsection (2)(b) in relation to—
(a)
any matter described in subsection (1)(a) may be expressed to have
effect from the commencement of any proceedings to which it relates
and for an indefinite period or until such date as the local authority con‐
siders appropriate in the circumstances:
(b)
any matter described in subsection (1)(b) may be expressed to have
effect from the commencement of any proceedings to which it relates but
shall cease to have any effect at the conclusion of those proceedings—
and upon the date that such order ceases to have effect, the provisions of the
Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 shall apply
accordingly in respect of any information that was the subject of any such
order.
(4)
Any party to any proceedings or class of proceedings before a local authority
may apply to the Environment Court for an order under section 279(3)(a) can‐
celling or varying any order made by the local authority under this section.
(5)

Relationship between national environmental standards and rules or
consents
(1)
A rule or resource consent that is more stringent than a national environmental
standard prevails over the standard, if the standard expressly says that a rule or
consent may be more stringent than it.
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1),—
(a)
a rule is more stringent than a standard if it prohibits or restricts an activ‐
ity that the standard permits or authorises:
(b)
a resource consent is more stringent than a standard if it imposes condi‐
tions on an activity that the standard does not impose or authorise.
(3)
A rule or resource consent that is more lenient than a national environmental
standard prevails over the standard if the standard expressly says that a rule or
consent may be more lenient than it.
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (3), a rule or resource consent is more lenient
than a standard if it permits or authorises an activity that the standard prohibits
or restricts.
(5)
A land use consent or a subdivision consent granted under the district rules
before the date on which a national environmental standard is published under
the Legislation Act 2019 prevails over the standard.
(6)
The following permits and consents prevail over a national environmental
standard:
(a)
a coastal, water, or discharge permit:
(b)
a land use consent granted in relation to a regional rule.
(6A) Subsection (6) applies—
(a)
if those permits or consents are granted before the date on which a rele‐
vant national environmental standard is published under the Legislation
Act 2019:
(b)
until a review of the conditions of the permit or consent under section
128(1)(ba) results in some or all of the standard prevailing over the per‐
mit or consent.
(7)
This subsection applies to a resource consent not covered by subsection (5) or
(6). The consent prevails over a national environmental standard if the applica‐
tion giving rise to the consent was the subject of a decision on whether to

Resource Management Act 1991
Part 5 s 43B
151

notify it before the date on which the standard is published under the Legis‐
lation Act 2019. However, the consent does not prevail if the standard
expressly provides otherwise.
(8)
[Repealed]
(9)
If a national environmental standard requires a resource consent to be obtained
for an activity, sections 10, 10A, 10B, and 20A(2) apply to the activity as if the
standard were a rule in a plan that had become operative.

68A
Regional coastal plan not to authorise aquaculture activities in coastal
marine area as permitted activities
(1)
Despite section 68, after the commencement of section 17 of the Resource
Management Amendment Act (No 2) 2011 no rule may be included in a
regional coastal plan which authorises as a permitted activity any aquaculture
activity in the coastal marine area.
(2)
If, immediately before the commencement of section 17 of the Resource Man‐
agement Amendment Act (No 2) 2011, a regional coastal plan contains a rule
that authorises as a permitted activity any part of an aquaculture activity in the
coastal marine area—
(a)
any person may act, or continue to act, in accordance with the rule until
any alteration of the rule has legal effect; but
(b)
a regional council must, as soon as is reasonably practicable and not
later than 2 years after the commencement of section 17 of the Resource
Management Amendment Act (No 2) 2011, initiate a review of the rule
under section 79 and propose to alter any provisions necessary to ensure
compliance with subsection (1), in the manner set out in Part 1 of Sched‐
ule 1 and this Part.

Rules relating to water quality
(1)
Where a regional council—
(a)
provides in a plan that certain waters are to be managed for any purpose
described in respect of any of the classes specified in Schedule 3; and
(b)
includes rules in the plan about the quality of water in those waters,—
the rules shall require the observance of the standards specified in that schedule
in respect of the appropriate class or classes unless, in the council’s opinion,
those standards are not adequate or appropriate in respect of those waters in
which case the rules may state standards that are more stringent or specific.
(2)
Where a regional council provides in a plan that certain waters are to be man‐
aged for any purpose for which the classes specified in Schedule 3 are not
adequate or appropriate, the council may state in the plan new classes and
standards about the quality of water in those waters.
(3)
Subject to the need to allow for reasonable mixing of a discharged contaminant
or water, a regional council shall not set standards in a plan which result, or
may result, in a reduction of the quality of the water in any waters at the time
of the public notification of the proposed plan unless it is consistent with the
purpose of this Act to do so.

Rules about discharges
(1)
Before a regional council includes in a regional plan a rule that allows as a per‐
mitted activity—
(a)
a discharge of a contaminant or water into water; or
(b)
a discharge of a contaminant onto or into land in circumstances which
may result in that contaminant (or any other contaminant emanating as a
result of natural processes from that contaminant) entering water,—
the regional council shall be satisfied that none of the following effects are
likely to arise in the receiving waters, after reasonable mixing, as a result of the
discharge of the contaminant (either by itself or in combination with the same,
similar, or other contaminants):
(c)
the production of conspicuous oil or grease films, scums or foams, or
floatable or suspended materials:
(d)
any conspicuous change in the colour or visual clarity:
(e)
any emission of objectionable odour:
(f)
the rendering of fresh water unsuitable for consumption by farm ani‐
mals:
(g)
any significant adverse effects on aquatic life.
(2)
Before a regional council includes in a regional plan a rule requiring the adop‐
tion of the best practicable option to prevent or minimise any actual or likely
adverse effect on the environment of any discharge of a contaminant, the
regional council shall be satisfied that, having regard to—
(a)
the nature of the discharge and the receiving environment; and
(b)
other alternatives, including a rule requiring the observance of minimum
standards of quality of the environment,—
the inclusion of that rule in the plan is the most efficient and effective means of
preventing or minimising those adverse effects on the environment.

A local authority may make a rule requiring a financial contribution for any
class of activity other than a prohibited activity.
(2)
A rule requiring a financial contribution must specify in the relevant plan or
proposed plan—
(a)
the purpose for which the financial contribution is required (which may
include the purpose of ensuring positive effects on the environment to
offset any adverse effect); and
(b)
how the level of the financial contribution will be determined; and
(c)
when the financial contribution will be required.

(3)
To avoid doubt, if a rule requiring a financial contribution is incorporated into a
specified territorial authority’s district plan under section 77G, the rule does not
have immediate legal effect under section 86B when an IPI incorporating the
standard is notified.
(4)
In this section and section 77T, financial contribution has the same meaning
as in section 108(9).

national planning standards means the national planning standards published
by the Ministry for the Environment in November 2019 and available on an
Internet site maintained by that ministry
urban environment means any area of land (regardless of size, and irrespect‐
ive of territorial authority or statistical boundaries) that—
(a)
is, or is intended by the specified territorial authority to be, predomin‐
antly urban in character; and
(b)
is, or is intended by the specified territorial authority to be, part of a
housing and labour market of at least 10,000 people

77G
Duty of specified territorial authorities to incorporate MDRS and give
effect to policy 3 or 5 in residential zones
(1)
Every relevant residential zone of a specified territorial authority must have the
MDRS incorporated into that zone.
(2)
Every residential zone in an urban environment of a specified territorial author‐
ity must give effect to policy 3 or policy 5, as the case requires, in that zone.
(3)
When changing its district plan for the first time to incorporate the MDRS and
to give effect to policy 3 or policy 5, as the case requires, and to meet its obli‐
gations in section 80F, a specified territorial authority must use an IPI and the
ISPP.

(4)
In carrying out its functions under this section, a specified territorial authority
may create new residential zones or amend existing residential zones.
(5)
A specified territorial authority—
(a)
must include the objectives and policies set out in clause 6 of Schedule
3A:
(b)
may include objectives and policies in addition to those set out in clause
6 of Schedule 3A, to—
(i)
provide for matters of discretion to support the MDRS; and
(ii)
link to the incorporated density standards to reflect how the terri‐
torial authority has chosen to modify the MDRS in accordance
with section 77H.
(6)
A specified territorial authority may make the requirements set out in Schedule
3A or policy 3 less enabling of development than provided for in that schedule
or by policy 3, if authorised to do so under section 77I.
(7)
To avoid doubt, existing provisions in a district plan that allow the same or a
greater level of development than the MDRS do not need to be amended or
removed from the district plan.
(8)
The requirement in subsection (1) to incorporate the MDRS into a relevant
residential zone applies irrespective of any inconsistent objective or policy in a
regional policy statement.

Requirements in Schedule 3A may be modified to enable greater
development
(1)
In addition to giving effect to policy 3 or policy 5, a specified territorial author‐
ity may enable a greater level of development than provided for by the MDRS
by—
(a)
omitting 1 or more of the density standards set out in Part 2 of Schedule
3A:
(b)
including rules that regulate the same effect as a density standard set out
in Part 2 of Schedule 3A, but that are more lenient than provided for by
the MDRS.
(2)
To avoid doubt, more lenient means the rule (including a requirement, condi‐
tion, or permission) permits an activity that the MDRS would restrict.
(3)
A specified territorial authority is considered to have met its obligations under
section 77G(1) by acting in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
(4)
A specified territorial authority may choose not to incorporate 1 or more den‐
sity standards set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3A into its district plan, but, in that
case, the authority may not (in its district plan) regulate the same effect as the
density standard.

accommodating the qualifying matter, in comparison with the level of
development that would have been permitted by the MDRS and pol‐
icy 3:
(e)
notify the existing qualifying matters in the IPI.
(2)
To avoid doubt, existing qualifying matters included in the IPI—
(a)
do not have immediate legal effect on notification of the IPI; but
(b)
continue to have effect as part of the operative plan.

Further requirement about application of section 77I(j)
A matter is not a qualifying matter under section 77I(j) in relation to an area
unless the evaluation report referred to in section 32 also—
(a)
identifies the specific characteristic that makes the level of development
provided by the MDRS (as specified in Schedule 3A or as provided for
by policy 3) inappropriate in the area; and
(b)
justifies why that characteristic makes that level of development
inappropriate in light of the national significance of urban development
and the objectives of the NPS-UD; and
(c)
includes a site-specific analysis that—
(i)
identifies the site to which the matter relates; and
(ii)
evaluates the specific characteristic on a site-specific basis to
determine the geographic area where intensification needs to be
compatible with the specific matter; and
(iii)
evaluates an appropriate range of options to achieve the greatest
heights and densities permitted by the MDRS (as specified in
Schedule 3A) or as provided for by policy 3 while managing the
specific characteristics.

(b)
that is lodged on or after the date on which a specified territorial author‐
ity notifies its IPI incorporating the MDRS in its district plan in accord‐
ance with section 80F(1) or (2), as applicable.
(2)
The consent authority considering the new application must consider the plan
or proposed plan and apply section 104(1)(b)(vi) in the following way:
(a)
the provisions of the district plan or any proposed district plan (other
than the IPI) cease to have effect in relation to the consideration of the
new application; and
(b)
the objectives and policies set out in clause 6 of Schedule 3A and pro‐
posed in the IPI to be included in the district plan in accordance with
section 77G(5)(a) apply in determining that new application.
(3)
Subsection (2)(a) applies to the extent that the provisions referred to are incon‐
sistent with the objectives and policies—

Subsection (6) applies if a designation for which the Minister of Education is
the requiring authority—
(a)
is included in the specified territorial authority’s district plan; and
(b)
the designation applies to land that—
(i)
is in a relevant residential zone; or
(ii)
adjoins a relevant residential zone.
(6)
Works undertaken under a designation of the kind referred to in subsection (5)
may rely on the provisions of the relevant residential zone that incorporate the
density standards in Part 2 of Schedule 3A if those provisions are more lenient
than conditions included in the designation.
(7)
Any objectives or policies of a regional policy statement or proposed regional
policy statement do not apply to the consent authority’s consideration of the
Part 5 s 77M
Resource Management Act 1991
Version as at

(b)
any activity that may, before the alteration of the boundaries, have been
undertaken under section 19 may continue to be undertaken as if the
alteration of the boundaries had not taken place.
(2)
Where the boundaries of any district are altered so as to include within that dis‐
trict any area not previously within the boundaries of any other district, no per‐
son may use that land unless expressly allowed by a resource consent, until a
district plan provides otherwise.
(3)
A territorial authority shall, as soon as practicable but within 2 years, make
such changes to its district plans as it considers necessary to cover any area that

Disputes
(1)
Subsection (2) applies if there is a dispute about—
(a)
whether there is an inconsistency between a water conservation order
and a regional policy statement or a plan; or
(b)
whether there is an inconsistency between a regional policy statement or
a regional plan and a district plan (including any rules of a plan) on a
matter of regional significance; or
(c)
whether a regional policy statement or a plan gives effect to a national
policy statement or New Zealand coastal policy statement or a national
planning standard.
(2)
A Minister or local authority responsible for a relevant national policy state‐
ment, New Zealand coastal policy statement, a national planning standard, pol‐
icy statement, plan, or order may refer a dispute to the Environment Court for a
decision resolving the matter.
Part 5 s 81
Resource Management Act 1991
Version as at
13 March 2025
234

(3)
If a dispute about whether there is an inconsistency described in subsection
(1)(a) or (b) is referred to the court, and the court considers that there is an
inconsistency, the court must order the authority responsible for the policy
statement or plan to remove the inconsistency by initiating a change to the pol‐
icy statement or plan using the process in Schedule 1.
(4)
If a dispute about whether a regional policy statement or a plan gives effect to a
national policy statement or New Zealand coastal policy statement or a national
planning standard is referred to the court, and the court considers that the pol‐
icy statement or plan does not give effect to the other policy statement or a
national planning standard, the court must order the authority responsible for
the policy statement or plan to amend it in accordance with section 55 or 58I.
(5)
However, the court does not need to make an order under subsection (3) or (4)
if it considers that the inconsistency, or failure to give effect to the other policy
statement or a national planning standard, is of minor significance that does not
affect the general intent and purpose of the policy statement, national planning
standard, plan, or water conservation order concerned.
(6)
To avoid doubt, giving effect to a policy statement includes giving effect to it
by complying with a direction described in section 55(2), and giving effect to
the national planning standard includes giving effect to it by complying with
section 58I(2).

(a)
in the case of a plan or proposed plan (other than a regional coastal plan

ever of the following the local authority considers appropriate:
(i)
modify, delete, or replace the provision in the plan or proposed

(b)
places an unfair and unreasonable burden on any person who has an
interest in the land.
(3C) Before exercising its jurisdiction under subsection (3A), the Environment
Court must have regard to—
(a)
Part 3 (including the effect of section 9(3); and

the person with the estate or interest in the land or part of the land con‐
cerned (or the spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner of that per‐
son)—
(i)
had acquired the estate or interest in the land or part of it before
the date on which the provision or proposed provision was first
notified or otherwise included in the relevant plan or proposed
plan; and
(ii)
the provision or proposed provision remained in substantially the
same form; and
(b)
the person with the estate or interest in the land or part of the land con‐
sents to the giving of the direction.

it is authorised to undertake, a regional council or territorial authority may,
while its plan is operative, acquire by agreement under the Public Works Act

(3)
Subsection (4) applies if a rule in a proposed plan—
(a)
meets the criteria specified in subsection (1)(a) and (c); and
(b)
would meet the criterion specified in subsection (1)(b) but for the fact
that it includes a proposed density standard that—
(i)
regulates the same effect as a density standard set out in Part 2 of
Schedule 3A; and
(ii)
is proposed, in accordance with section 77H(1)(b), to be more
lenient than provided for by the MDRS.
(4)
If this subsection applies,—
(a)
the proposed density standard does not have immediate legal effect; but
(b)
all other density standards referred to in subsection (1)(b) have immedi‐
ate legal effect and subsection (2) applies to those standards as if they

the rule referred to in subsection (1)—
(i)
omits, in accordance with section 77H(1)(a), a density standard
set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3A; or
(ii)
includes an additional requirement, condition, or permission regu‐
lating an effect other than those set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3A;
and
(b)
the omitted density standard, or the additional requirement, condition, or
permission, regulates the same effect as a rule (including a density stand‐
ard, requirement, condition, or permission) in the operative plan (the
operative rule).
(6)
If this subsection applies, the operative rule continues to have legal effect until
the date on which the proposed plan becomes operative.

that requires consent under a district plan (other than a subdivision of
land); and
(b)
includes an address for service that is an electronic address.
(2)
An application described in subsection (1) ceases to be a fast-track application
if—
(a)
a consent authority gives public or limited notification of the application;
or

a hearing is to be held for the application; or
(c)
at the time the application is lodged, the applicant notifies the consent
authority that the applicant wishes to opt out of the fast track process.

subsection (2)(a) or (b),—
(a)
the application is not incomplete by reason only that it does not include
the information referred to in section 88(2)(c); but

the application becomes subject to the standard processing requirements
(including any time periods for doing anything) under this Act that
would have applied if the application had not been a fast-track applica‐
tion; and
(b)
those time periods are deemed to have been running from the time they
would have begun if this section had not applied and are not reset as
from the time the application ceases to be fast-track.

a discharge of a contaminant onto or into land in circumstances which
may result in that contaminant (or any other contaminant emanating as a
result of natural processes from that contaminant) entering water; or
(ba)
the dumping in the coastal marine area from any ship, aircraft, or off‐
shore installation of any waste or other matter that is a contaminant,—
if, after reasonable mixing, the contaminant or water discharged (either by
itself or in combination with the same, similar, or other contaminants or water),
is likely to give rise to all or any of the following effects in the receiving
waters:
(c)
the production of any conspicuous oil or grease films, scums or foams,
or floatable or suspended materials:

(a)
that exceptional circumstances justify the granting of the permit; or
(b)
that the discharge is of a temporary nature; or
(c)
that the discharge is associated with necessary maintenance work—
and that it is consistent with the purpose of this Act to do so.
(2A) A consent authority may grant a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 or 15A that may allow
the effects described in subsection (1)(g) if the consent authority—
(a)
is satisfied that, at the time of granting, there are already effects
described in subsection (1)(g) in the receiving waters; and
(b)
imposes conditions on the permit; and
(c)
is satisfied that those conditions will contribute to a reduction of the
effects described in subsection (1)(g) over the duration of the permit.
(3)
In addition to any other conditions imposed under this Act, a discharge permit
or coastal permit may include conditions requiring the holder of the permit to
undertake such works in such stages throughout the term of the permit as will
ensure that upon the expiry of the permit the holder can meet the requirements
of subsection (1) and of any relevant regional rules.

If subsection (4) applies and the chief executive has notified the consent
authority that an aquaculture agreement or compensation declaration has been

permit, as amended, is to be treated as having commenced on the commence‐
ment date notified under subsection (5)(c), unless the permit states a later date.

lodged with and granted by the EPA, the references in this section to the con‐
sent authority are to be read as references to the consent authority that other‐
wise could have granted the application.

(b)
within 3 months after service of the notice, an application is made to the

holder
(1)
The holder of a resource consent may apply to a consent authority for a change
or cancellation of a condition of the consent, subject to the following:
(a)
the holder of a subdivision consent must apply under this section for a
change or cancellation of the consent before the deposit of the survey
plan (and must apply under section 221 for a variation or cancellation of

condition on the duration of the consent.
(2)

only to the change or cancellation of a condition and the effects of the
change or cancellation respectively.
(3A) If the resource consent is a coastal permit authorising aquaculture activities to
be undertaken in the coastal marine area, no aquaculture decision is required in
respect of the application if the application is for a change or cancellation of a
condition of the consent and does not relate to a condition that has been speci‐

fied under section 186H(3) of the Fisheries Act 1996 as a condition that may
not be changed or cancelled until the chief executive of the Ministry of Fisher‐
ies makes a further aquaculture decision.

For the purposes of determining who is adversely affected by the change or
cancellation, the consent authority must consider, in particular, every person
who—
(a)
made a submission on the original application; and
(b)
may be affected by the change or cancellation.

Review of consent conditions by consent authority
128
Circumstances when consent conditions can be reviewed
(1)
A consent authority may, in accordance with section 129, serve notice on a
consent holder of its intention to review the conditions of a resource consent—
(a)
at any time or times specified for that purpose in the consent for any of
the following purposes:
(i)
to deal with any adverse effect on the environment which may
arise from the exercise of the consent and which it is appropriate
to deal with at a later stage; or
(ii)
to require a holder of a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 or 15B to
adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse
effect on the environment; or
(iii)
for any other purpose specified in the consent; or
(b)
in the case of a coastal, water, or discharge permit, or a land use consent
granted by a regional council, if—
(i)
a regional plan contains a rule that relates to maximum or min‐
imum levels or flows or rates of use of water, or minimum stand‐
ards of water quality or air quality, or ranges of temperature or
pressure of geothermal water; and
(ii)
the rule has been made operative; and
Version as at

Resource Management Act 1991
Part 6 s 128
325

(iii)
the regional council considers that it is appropriate to review the
conditions of the permit or consent in order to enable the levels,
flows, rates, or standards set by the rule to be met; or
(ba)
in the case of a coastal, water, or discharge permit, or a land use consent
granted by a regional council, when relevant national environmental
standards or national planning standards have been made; or
(bb)
in the case of a land use consent, in relation to a relevant regional rule;
or
(c)
if the information made available to the consent authority by the appli‐
cant for the consent for the purposes of the application contained inac‐
curacies which materially influenced the decision made on the applica‐
tion and the effects of the exercise of the consent are such that it is
necessary to apply more appropriate conditions; or
(d)
if the review is part of a review carried out under subsection (2A).
(2)
A consent authority must, in accordance with section 129, serve notice on a
consent holder of its intention to review the conditions of a resource consent if
required by an order made under section 339(5)(b).
(2A) If more than 1 resource consent is affected by the rule referred to in subsection
(1)(b)(i), the consent authority may review the conditions of those resource
consents together for the purpose of managing the effects of the activities car‐
ried out under those resource consents.
(3)
A regional council must notify the chief executive of the Ministry of Fisheries
as soon as is reasonably practicable if it intends to review a condition of a
coastal permit authorising an aquaculture activity to be undertaken in the
coastal marine area and the condition has been specified under section
186H(1A) of the Fisheries Act 1996 as a condition that may not be changed or
cancelled until the chief executive of the Ministry of Fisheries makes a further
aquaculture decision.

shall have regard to the matters in section 104 and to whether the activ‐
ity allowed by the consent will continue to be viable after the change;
and

in the case of a review under section 128(2), must have regard to any
reasons that the court provided for making the order requiring the
review; and
(b)
may have regard to the manner in which the consent has been used.
(2)
Before changing the conditions of a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 (relating to the dis‐
charge of contaminants) or 15B to include a condition requiring the holder to
adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse effect on the
environment, the consent authority shall be satisfied, in the particular circum‐
stances and having regard to—
(a)
the nature of the discharge and the receiving environment; and
(b)
the financial implications for the applicant of including that condition;
and

(c)
other alternatives, including a condition requiring the observance of min‐
imum standards of quality of the receiving environment—
that including that condition is the most efficient and effective means of remov‐
ing or reducing that adverse effect.

a local authority.
(3)
The holder may make the transfer if it is for another site and is to any person, if

allows the transfer; or
(b)
allows the holder to apply to the consent authority that granted the per‐
mit to be allowed to make the transfer.

138A Special provisions relating to coastal permits for dumping and
incineration
(1)
Without limiting section 104, when considering an application for a coastal
permit to do something that would otherwise contravene section 15A(1), the
consent authority shall, in having regard to the actual and potential effects of
allowing the activity, have regard to—
(a)
the nature of any discharge of any contaminant which the dumping or
incineration may involve and the sensitivity of the receiving environ‐
ment to adverse effects and the applicant’s reasons for making the pro‐
posed choice; and
(b)
any possible alternative methods of disposal or combustion including
any involving discharge into any other receiving environment,—
and, without limiting the powers of the consent authority under section 92, it
may, at any reasonable time before the hearing (or, if there is no hearing, the
determination) of the application, by written notice to the applicant, require the
applicant to provide, by way of further information, an explanation of those
matters.
(2)
Without limiting section 108, but subject to subsection (5), a coastal permit to
which subsection (1) applies may include a condition requiring the holder to
adopt the best practicable option to prevent or minimise any actual or likely
adverse effect on the environment of any discharge of any contaminant which
may occur in the exercise of the permit; provided that before a consent author‐
ity decides to grant a coastal permit subject to such a condition, it shall be satis‐
fied that, in the particular circumstances, and having regard to—
(a)
the nature of any discharge of a contaminant and the receiving environ‐
ment; and
(b)
other alternatives, including any condition requiring the observance of
minimum standards of quality of the receiving environment,—
the inclusion of the condition is the most efficient and effective means of pre‐
venting or minimising any actual or likely adverse effect on the environment.
(3)
In respect of a coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene
section 15A(1), a consent authority may, at any time specified for that purpose
in the permit, in accordance with section 129, serve notice on the holder of the
permit of its intention to review the conditions of the permit for the purpose of
requiring the holder to adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce
any adverse effect on the environment.

(4)
Subject to subsection (5), sections 129 to 133 shall apply to any review of a
coastal permit under subsection (3) and the powers conferred on a consent
authority by that subsection are in addition to the powers conferred by section
128.
(5)
Before deciding to grant a coastal permit subject to a condition described in
subsection (2) and before deciding to change the conditions of a coastal permit
pursuant to subsections (3) and (4), the consent authority shall be satisfied, in
the particular circumstances, and having regard to—
(a)
the nature of any discharge of a contaminant and the receiving environ‐
ment; and
(b)
the financial implications for the holder of including that condition; and
(c)
other alternatives, including a condition requiring the observance of min‐
imum standards of quality of the receiving environment—
that including a condition in the permit requiring the holder to adopt the best
practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse effect on the environment
is the most efficient and effective means of removing or reducing that adverse
effect.
(6)
In every coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene sec‐
tion 15A(1), there shall be implied a condition that the holder shall, in the pre‐
scribed form and at the cost of the holder in all respects, keep such records and
furnish to the Director of Maritime New Zealand such information and returns
as may from time to time be required by regulations.

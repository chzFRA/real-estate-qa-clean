function or an activity of the agency; and
(b)
the collection of the information is necessary for that purpose.

(1)
An agency (A) may disclose personal information to a foreign person or
entity (B) in reliance on IPP 11(1)(a), (c), (e), (f), (h), or (i) only if—

the individual concerned authorises the disclosure to B after
being expressly informed by A that B may not be required to
protect the information in a way that, overall, provides compar‐
able safeguards to those in this Act; or
(b)

knowledge, is the same unique identifier as has been assigned to that
individual by another agency (B), unless—
(a)
A and B are associated persons within the meaning of subpart
YB of the Income Tax Act 2007; or
(b)
the unique identifier is to be used by A for statistical or research
purposes and no other purpose.
(3)
To avoid doubt, A does not assign a unique identifier to an individual
under subclause (1) by simply recording a unique identifier assigned to
the individual by B for the sole purpose of communicating with B about
the individual.
(4)
A must take any steps that are, in the circumstances, reasonable to
ensure that—
(a)
a unique identifier is assigned only to an individual whose iden‐
tity is clearly established; and

fier assigned to that individual unless the disclosure is for one of the
purposes in connection with which that unique identifier was assigned
or is for a purpose that is directly related to one of those purposes.

Application of Legislation Act 2019 to codes
(1)
A code of practice is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act
2019 for publication requirements).

That Act applies as if—
(a)
the Commissioner were the maker of the code; and
(b)
the code were made by the Commissioner issuing it.

Sch 1 cl 14
• notify it in the Gazette stating that it has been issued
and specifying a place at which copies of it are available
for inspection free of charge and for purchase
• ensure that, so long as it remains in force, it is publicly
available on an Internet site maintained by, or on behalf
of, the maker
• make it available for inspection by members of the
public free of charge
• make it available for purchase by members of the public
at a reasonable price
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade considers
that the secondary legislation may have international
transparency obligations under the CPTPP. As a result
the maker may also have to comply with s 75 of the

(1)
On receiving an IPP 6 request, an agency may extend the time limit set out in
section 43 or 44 in respect of the request if—

the request is for a large quantity of information, or necessitates a search
through a large quantity of information, and meeting the original time
limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the agency; or
(b)
consultations necessary to make a decision on the request are such that
a response to the request cannot reasonably be given within the original
time limit; or

time limit.
(2)
Any extension under subsection (1) must be for a reasonable period of time

the physical or mental health of the requestor) would be likely to
prejudice the health of the individual concerned; or

be likely to unreasonably prejudice the commercial position of the per‐
son who supplied the information or who is the subject of the informa‐
tion.
(2)

the disclosure of the information would breach legal professional privil‐
ege; or

ial placed in any library or museum or archive, would breach a condition
subject to which that material was placed; or
(f)
the disclosure of the information would constitute contempt of court or
of the House of Representatives; or
(g)
the request is made by a defendant or a defendant’s agent and is—
(i)
for information that could be sought by the defendant under the
Criminal Disclosure Act 2008; or
(ii)
for information that could be sought by the defendant under that
Act and that has been disclosed to, or withheld from, the defend‐
ant under that Act; or

Agency may impose conditions instead of refusing access to personal
information
(1)
This section applies if an agency has good reason under any of sections 49 to

55
Withholding personal information contained in document

information, the agency may decide to grant the requestor access to a copy
of that document under section 44(2)(c)(i) with any deletions or alterations in
respect of the information that could be withheld that it considers necessary.
(2)
If information is withheld under subsection (1), the agency must inform the
requestor of—

the reason for the decision to withhold the information; and
(b)
the requestor’s right to make a complaint to the Commissioner in respect
of that decision.
(3)
The agency must also disclose to the requestor the grounds in support of the
reason for the decision to withhold the information if—
(a)
the reason is that set out in section 50(1); or

(b)
the reason is not that set out in section 50(1), but the requestor has

However,—
(a)
subsection (3)(a) does not apply if disclosing the grounds would preju‐
dice the interests protected by section 50(1):
(b)

means a privacy breach that it is reasonable to believe has caused serious
harm to an affected individual or individuals or is likely to do so (see
section 113 for factors that must be considered by an agency when
assessing whether a privacy breach is likely to cause serious harm); but
(b)
does not include a privacy breach if the personal information that is the

information is held solely for the purposes of, or in connection with, the
individual’s personal or domestic affairs
privacy breach, in relation to personal information held by an agency,—
(a)
means—
(i)

is attributable in whole or in part to any action by the agency; or
(iii)
is ongoing.
(2)
For the purposes of this subpart, the meanings of access, disclosure, and loss
are not limited by the use of those words or the meanings ascribed to them
elsewhere in this Act.
113
Assessment of likelihood of serious harm being caused by privacy breach
When an agency is assessing whether a privacy breach is likely to cause
serious harm in order to decide whether the breach is a notifiable privacy
breach, the agency must consider the following:
(a)
any action taken by the agency to reduce the risk of harm following the
breach:
(b)
whether the personal information is sensitive in nature:
(c)
the nature of the harm that may be caused to affected individuals:
(d)
the person or body that has obtained or may obtain personal information
as a result of the breach (if known):
(e)
whether the personal information is protected by a security measure:
(f)
any other relevant matters.

An agency must notify the Commissioner as soon as practicable after becom‐
ing aware that a notifiable privacy breach has occurred.
115
Agency to notify affected individual or give public notice of notifiable
privacy breach
(1)
An agency must notify an affected individual as soon as practicable after
becoming aware that a notifiable privacy breach has occurred, unless subsec‐
tion (2) or an exception in section 116 applies or a delay is permitted under
section 116(4).
(2)
If it is not reasonably practicable to notify an affected individual or each
member of a group of affected individuals, the agency must instead give public
notice of the privacy breach, unless an exception in section 116 applies or a
delay is permitted under section 116(4).
(3)
Public notice must be given—
(a)
in a form in which no affected individual is identified; and
(b)
in accordance with any regulations made under section 215(1)(a).

Version as at
26 January 2025
78

(4)
If subsection (2) or an exception in section 116 is relied on, the agency must
notify the affected individual or individuals at a later time if—
(a)
circumstances change so that subsection (2) or the exception no longer
applies; and
(b)
at that later time, there is or remains a risk that the privacy breach will
cause serious harm to the affected individual or individuals.
(5)
A failure to notify an affected individual or give public notice under this
section may be an interference with privacy under this Act (see section
69(2)(a)(iv)).
116
Exceptions to or delay in complying with requirement to notify affected
individuals or give public notice of notifiable privacy breach
(1)
An agency is not required to notify an affected individual or give public notice
of a notifiable privacy breach if the agency believes that the notification or
notice would be likely to—
(a)
prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international
relations of the Government of New Zealand; or
(b)
prejudice the maintenance of the law by any public sector agency,
including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and
the right to a fair trial; or
(c)
endanger the safety of any person; or
(d)
reveal a trade secret.
(2)
An agency is not required to notify an affected individual or give public notice
(relating to a particular individual) of a notifiable privacy breach—
(a)
if the individual is under the age of 16 and the agency believes that the
notification or notice would be contrary to that individual’s interests; or
(b)
if, after consultation is undertaken by the agency with the individual’s
health practitioner (where practicable), the agency believes that the
notification or notice would be likely to prejudice the health of the
individual.
(3)
If subsection (2) applies, the agency must—
(a)
consider whether it would be appropriate to notify a representative
instead of the individual (if a representative is known or can be readily
identified); and
(b)
before deciding whether to notify a representative, take into account the
circumstances of both the individual and the privacy breach; and
(c)
if the agency decides it is appropriate to notify a representative and has
identified a representative, notify that person.

79

(4)
An agency may delay notifying an affected individual (or a representative) or
giving public notice of a notifiable privacy breach (but not delay notifying the
Commissioner) only—
(a)
if the agency believes that a delay is necessary because notification or
public notice may have risks for the security of personal information
held by the agency and those risks outweigh the benefits of informing
affected individuals; and
(b)
for a period during which those risks continue to outweigh those bene‐
fits.
(5)
An agency may rely on an exception, or delay in notifying affected individuals
or giving public notice, under this section and, in relation to a delay, do so
for the period referred to in subsection (4)(b), only if the agency believes on
reasonable grounds that the exception applies, the ground for delay exists, or
the circumstances referred to in subsection (4)(b) (relating to the period of
delay) continue to exist.

reasonable grounds that identification is necessary to prevent or lessen a ser‐
ious threat to the life or health of the affected individual or another individual.
(4)
A notification to an affected individual must not include any particulars about
any other affected individuals.
(5)

118
Offence to fail to notify Commissioner

It is a defence to a charge under this section that the agency did not consider
the privacy breach to be a notifiable privacy breach, but only if it was reason‐
able to do so in the circumstances.
119
Section 211 does not apply to processes and proceedings relating to failure
to notify notifiable privacy breach
Section 211 (which refers to the liability of employers, principals, and agen‐
cies) does not apply to processes or proceedings under this Act relating to the

This section applies to processes and proceedings under this Act relating to the
obligations under section 114 or 115.

employer or agency failing to notify the Commissioner or an affected person
(or their representative) or give public notice of a notifiable privacy breach.
(3)
For the purpose of those processes and proceedings, anything done or omitted
by an officer, an employee, or a member of an agency is to be treated as being
done or omitted by the employer or agency.

For the purpose of those processes and proceedings, anything done or omitted
by an agent of another agency is to be treated as being done or omitted by both
the agent and the principal agency.
(5)
However, the extent of liability of an agent is affected by whether they hold
personal information that is the subject of a notifiable privacy breach. See the
definition of privacy breach in section 112 and see section 11, which applies
and which provides that information held by an agent is to be treated as being
held by the principal agency unless section 11(3) applies.

Compare: 1993 No 28 s 114A
193
Prohibition on transfer of personal information outside New Zealand
(1)
The Commissioner may prohibit a transfer of personal information from New
Zealand to another country if the Commissioner is satisfied, on reasonable
grounds, that—

the information has been, or will be, received in New Zealand from
another country and is likely to be transferred to a third country where it
will not be subject to a law providing comparable safeguards to those in
this Act; and
(b)
the transfer would be likely to lead to a contravention of the basic
principles of national application set out in Part Two of the OECD
Guidelines and in Schedule 8 of this Act.
(2)
In determining whether to prohibit a transfer of personal information, the Com‐
missioner must also consider, in addition to the matters set out in subsection (1)
and section 21, the following:
(a)
whether the transfer affects, or is likely to affect, any individual; and
(b)
the general desirability of facilitating the free flow of information
between New Zealand and other countries; and

any existing or developing international guidelines relevant to transbor‐
der data flows, including (but not limited to)—
(i)
the OECD Guidelines:
(ii)

under that subpart.
(2)

Commissioner may vary or cancel transfer prohibition notice

cancelled; or
(b)
has been refused and give the reason for the refusal.
